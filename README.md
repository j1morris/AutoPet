## Motivation
Most people that have raised pets know that the key to successfully training them is consistency. That is, using the same clear voice commands every time your pet does the action associated with the command. However, most pet owners do not have the luxury of being with their pets 24/7. Therefore, there are times when the pet is on their own, acting on their impulses, often slowing down the training process. For instance, say you are training your dog to stay off the couch. When you are there with them, you can easily tell them “off” when they go on the couch. You can also easily reward them for not going on the couch, reinforcing the training. However, when you go off to work, your pet is on their own and they might find the couch comfier than their bed. Therefore, there is no one there to continue the consistent training and the pet gets mixed signals about the couch. This significantly slows down or outright prevents the pet from learning that they are not allowed on the couch. We are proposing a solution to this problem, remote automated pet training and monitoring.

## Project Overview
Our remote automated pet training and monitoring is a system of sensors connected to a central computer that will both monitor your pet as well as automatically reinforce their training. Our system accomplishes these two tasks in the following ways: 1) The sensors collect information about the environment and how your pet is interacting with it and sends that information to the central computer. 2) The central computer then processes the sensor information and performs automated training if the sensors detect your pet’s behavior needs to be corrected. With our remote automated pet training framework, the user has the ability to add any sensors they want to the system to help them automate training their pets. They also have the ability to determine when and how the system should react to their pet by setting up automations based on the sensor information.
Going back to the couch example, a user could add a camera sensor to the system and link the camera feed to the framework. They would then be able to indicate where the couch is in the camera feed. Then, if they also add a speaker to the system they would be able to set up an automation to be consistent with the “off” command they are trying to teach their dog. For instance, when the dog appears on the couch, the speaker can play a pre-recorded message of the user saying the “off” command. The dog would then hop off the couch like when the user is normally home! This helps train pets by giving owners the ability to stay consistent with commands they are trying to teach their pets when they are not even home. We plan on implementing support for a variety of sensors. We also plan to test the ability of our system to be easily user programmable by creating and testing multiple use cases.
Compared to existing solutions, our proposed product is highly customizable and expandable rather than a specific one use product with zero expandability. We also offer automation. Existing solutions allow users to simply monitor their pet, manually interact with them through a speaker, and dispense a treat [1].
